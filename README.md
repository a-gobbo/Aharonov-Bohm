# Numerical Study of Aharonov-Bohm effect
This code presents a numerical study of the Aharonov-Bohm effect, a quantum phenomenon where a magnetic field confined within a solenoid can influence the behavior of an electron wave packet moving outside of it. 

The Aharonov-Bohm effect is numerically reproduced by solving the time-dependant Schr√∂dinger equation, using a finite difference scheme on a lattice. A wave packet is created and scattered into a wall with two slits. Interference patterns observed before and after the magnetic field is turned on are set side by side, and the shift obtained is compared with the expected one due to Aharonov-Bohm effect.

This work is part of bachelor's thesis by Andrea Gobbo, supervised by Prof. Mattia Bruno (University of Milan-Bicocca). Further theoretical and numerical developments can be found in the file attached under the name "thesis.pdf".
