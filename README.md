# Numerical Study of Aharonov-Bohm effect
This code presents a numerical study of the Aharonov-Bohm effect, a quantum phenomenon where a magnetic field confined within a solenoid can influence the behavior of an electron wave packet moving outside it. 

The Aharonov-Bohm effect is studied numerically by solving the time-dependant Schr√∂dinger equation using a finite difference scheme on a lattice. Solutions of wave packets on the lattice before and after the magnetic field is turned on are set side by side, and the expected inteference pattern shift obtained is compared with the expected one.
